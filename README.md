### I build and document the data systems for bringing data to decentralized data architecture

- **Development Open Data Solution**: building a data toolkit for data engineering [StringX](https://stringx.longdatadevlog/category/start-here), enable data with [DataPods](https://datapods-oss.vercel.app)
- **Technical Blogs**: reaching readers with technical posts at [Blogs](/blogs/) and on [Talk & Share](https://youtube.com/@longdatadevlog/)
- **Maintain Data Engineering [Books](/books)**: helping others organize and search daily data engineering questions [Data Engineering Handbook](https://de-book.longdatadevlog.com) and breaking data systematic problems with [Solid Data Foundations](https://sdf-book.longdatadevlog.com)
