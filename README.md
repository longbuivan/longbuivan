# ðŸ““ Hi, I'm Long.

Here are recent thoughts... [â†’ see it](www.longdatadevlog.com/brain)

I am a typical engineer, and I build and document the data systems for bringing data to decentralized data ecosystems. I write and talk to reinforce the self-learning. Trying to explain things better and simpler, and use [knowledge package management](www.longdatadevlog.com/brain/create-a-second-brain-with-para) to shape everything firmly relevant with Mapping of Contents (MoC).

- I create Data Camping: building a Labs for learning and practicing data projects. Check out the 9 weeks of data with [LongDDL's Data Camping](www.de-book.longdatadevlog.com/datacamping).

- I develop framework for centralize Data Solution: building a data toolkit for data engineering [StringX](https://stringx.longdatadevlog.com/category/start-here), fast platform-ops with Modern Open-Source Data Stack with [DataPods](https://datapods-oss.vercel.app). 

- I write technical blogs: reaching readers with technical posts at [Blogs](www.longdatadevlog.com/blogs). A author of [Data Engineering Handbook](www.de-book.longdatadevlog.com) which is helping others organize and search daily data engineering questions. I'm creating the starting (mini) data platform-ops of [Serverless Data Platform (Starting Kit)](https://github.com/longbuivan/dfs-starter-kit)

- Community Engagement: hosting local meetups for the data engineering community, supporting engineers to excel together, and connecting through our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/FFcVzgrFBB)
